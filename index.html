                        <p>Pong is one of the earliest and most iconic video games in history. It was created by Allan Alcorn and released by Atari in 1972.
                        </p>
                        <p>Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis (ping-pong). Here's how it works:</p>
                        <p>The game screen shows two paddles (one on each side of the screen) and a ball that moves back and forth.

                        Each player controls a paddle, moving it vertically to hit the ball.

                        The goal is to hit the ball past the opponent's paddle to score a point.

                        The ball bounces off the top and bottom walls and the paddles.

                        The game continues until a player reaches a certain number of points or indefinitely, depending on the version.</p>
